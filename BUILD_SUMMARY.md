### 🚀 Quick Fix Solutions

**✅ COMPLETED: Gesture Handler Fixed**
```bash
npm install react-native-gesture-handler@2.18.1  # ✅ DONE
cd android && ./gradlew clean  # ✅ DONE
```

**🔄 NEXT: Fix Autolinking Issue**
```bash
# Remove duplicate generated files
rm -rf android/app/build/generated/autolinking
rm -rf android/app/build/generated/rncli

# Clean and rebuild
cd android && ./gradlew clean assembleDebug
```

**Alternative: Manual Package Management**
